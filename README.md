<h1>Overview</h1>

Alpha Bubbles is a game created for the Atari ST (or specifically STeem, an emulator for the Atari ST) written mostly in C, and a bit of 68000 Assembly.  It was created as part of the COMP 2659 course at MRU. Alpha Bubbles runs with minimal support from the operating system using custom-made raster and PSG functions, as well as a custom keyboard ISR.

All of the game's visual assets, including the font, were created by me.
